  ## Description
  This is a command line program that prompts the user to create Departments, Roles and Employees via the Inquirer package.  Express is used to save each entry to the database within their corresponding tables.  Once information exists within these tables you can view all Departments, Roles and Employees from the command line and even update the role of an existing Employee.
